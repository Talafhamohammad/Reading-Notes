**The fixed mindset believes that capabilities cannot be changed or developed! So he wants to appear as an intelligent person! He avoids change or challenges, because failure or error may appear stupid or wrongly! He makes no effort because he thinks nothing can change! Can not  accept constructive criticism He fears the success of others and considers it a threat.
An evolving mindset believes that capabilities can be acquired and developed. So he always wants to learn. He loves challenges and accepts change, and believes that making effort is necessary for development. Accept constructive criticism. He learns from and accepts the success of others**
