the first one is talking about the text editor according to the operating system we work on and also he mentioned several type of text editor like notebad++, atom , subline , text wrangler .. etc.
and also the difference between them and how we can choose the right one or the most fit with our work .

the second paragraph which is related to commands line and how we can deal with it also with some examples about commands 
and talked about easy way to save your time on retyping the cods that we can just hit the up or down arrows to reach the previous one we wrote because its stored and we can reach them easily . 

the third one mentioned some important commands like how we can know the directory we work in and showing all content in that directory or moving forward or backward between directory and explain the difference between relative directory and absolute directory.

the last one also is talking as same as the third one but in bit wide range and another concept and some new commands that dose different actions specifically talking about file type or in another way    the files extension and how we reach it beside that the meaning of hidden files and how its looks like finally its mentioned some feature of linux like case sensitivity .
